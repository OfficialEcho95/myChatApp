Real-Time Chat Application
Description:
Develop a real-time chat application using JavaScript for the backend. This project will involve creating a server that handles WebSocket connections for real-time communication between clients. You can use popular frameworks like Node.js and libraries like Socket.io to simplify WebSocket handling.

Features:

User Authentication:

Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.
Real-Time Messaging:

Implement real-time messaging functionality using WebSockets.
Users should be able to join different chat rooms or have private one-on-one conversations.
User Presence:

Display the online/offline status of users.
Show when users are typing.
Message History:

Store and display chat history so that users can see past messages when they join a room.
Notifications:

Send notifications to users when they receive new messages, even if they are not currently in the chat.
Emojis and File Sharing:

Allow users to send emojis.
Implement basic file-sharing functionality.
User Profile:

Users should have profiles with avatars and other optional details.
Security:

Implement security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Tech Stack:

Backend:

Node.js
Express.js or another web framework
Socket.io for real-time communication
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
Database:

MongoDB or another NoSQL database for storing user data and chat history.
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React, Vue, or vanilla JS)
WebSocket library for the frontend (if not using a framework that handles it)
Bonus Features:

Multiple Rooms: Allow users to create and join different chat rooms.
User Roles: Implement roles such as admin, moderator, and regular user.
Message Formatting: Enable users to send messages with basic formatting (e.g., bold, italic).
Integration: Integrate with external services (e.g., Giphy API for sending GIFs).
This project will not only enhance your backend skills but also give you hands-on experience with real-time applications and user authentication. Remember to incorporate best practices, write clean and maintainable code, and consider deploying the application to a cloud platform for a complete project experience
